Basics of shell scripting:

Shell scripting:
why? Shell-way to talks to your o/s.
To create file-GUI will be not in servers-- we have to do in Command Line way.
This CLI through which you talk to your o/s called shell commands..

Linux- the way we talk to o/s is using shell commands.. Shells 99% servers we are using in prod 
default come with shell environment - we konw shell commands we can talk with linux o/s.

Commands commnon - across all distributions.. 
 Like create file - linux GUI is not possible- bcz its heavy - n prod sys we make use of shell commands to 
 create files etc...,,,,,
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automatiuon-reduce manual activity--we have choosen Automation..
Linux machine-write 1 to 10. we use echo command-- if no incr 10 to 1,00,0000....
So we need automation(like some one says 100 files create) than manual not possible by using touch..but 10000
we need automation like shell scripting.

SS-is process of automating day-day activity or reguar activties on linux computer.
this is the reason we need SS

How to write??

1..sh is shell script extension for python py

The shebang (#!) is a symbol at the start of a script that tells
 the system which program to use to run the script. 
It’s followed by the path to that program.

bash,dash,sh,kash??? This all diff execetables of shell scritpitng.
Lets say we run java who is excuting--so like that someone needs to execeute the scripts..
Just has syntax diff bw the types of excetables..

So, bash is for advanced scripting, sh is for basic scripts.

Bash= Widely used.
For a Bash script, it looks like this: #!/bin/bash
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
role of ss inside devops??
1.we have Infra manintance(infra of org)   
2.we maintanig code(using Linux in GIT)
3.Lot of configratioin managment

For this purpose on day to day basis we use shell scripting.
regaular automation. or monior the health of nodes.

Eg: devops engg john at amazon-noticed that 10,000 VM's. all are linux based.
Some reason all of this VM monior node of this VM's.
every time - go to VM- developer says the CPU is gng out-mmeory is running out - linux is slow.
everytime jhon-goes the machine and fix that..
Instated he make a use of shell scriping:
1.He write one simple SS-saves in git repo. whnever some dev says 999 Vm no is issue.
John just execut the shell script-on local machine.. The ss logs in machine and looks into all
paramertes like CPU,memory and why are process gng slow-which files are runnig
how files open in machione..
--------------------------------

O/p:
Script says i execeuted the script and inoticed is the memory is completly used in one the nodes.
or Jhon though every time getting req for memory being used=let me do once every two days 
basically gets executed and look into this all this 10,0000

Logs in status of 10,000 and send out email that I have eveulated all on this 10 suspecious.
and 5 machines memeory issies- 5 machins issies with CPU.

One of the use case:
Interview?
Why u use SS:
1.I have automated all node health of my VM-so we have 1000 VM
everytime iys diff to moniotor the node health or status of the VM.we decide to write Scripts.
In our org we are not using other tools bcz are only restrcvting for some paramerts 
but in my SS we fetch more paramerts compare the other tools.

4.
----------------
if- Starts the conditional block.
Checks the condition inside [ ... ].
==: Checks equality between user_name and "admin".
$user_name: Refers to the value stored in the variable user_name.
---
then:
Specifies what to do if the condition is true.
echo "Welcome, admin!"
Prints the message if user_name equals "admin".
else:echo "Access denied."
fi:Ends the conditional block.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
elif means "else if". It checks another condition if the first if is false.

user_name="guest"
-------------------------------
if [ $user_name == "admin" ]; then
    echo "Welcome, admin!"
elif [ $user_name == "guest" ]; then
    echo "Welcome, guest!"
else
    echo "Access denied."
fi

Functions
Reuse code with functions.
A function is a block of code that you can reuse in your script.
 It helps avoid writing the same commands again and again.
 Syntax:
function_name() {
    # Commands
}
----------------------------------
# Define a function
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

# Call the function
greet "Alice"
greet "Bob"
---------------------------
o/p:
Hello, Alice!  
Hello, Bob!  

greet is the function name.
$1 is the first input you give to the function.
-------------------------------------------
Execute the Script: Save the script (e.g., script.sh) and make it executable:
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions

Reuse code with functions.
bash
Copy
Edit
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}
greet "DevOps Engineer"
Execute the Script

Save the script (e.g., script.sh) and make it executable:
bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
Example Shell Script:
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

# This script greets the user and shows system information.

# Greet the user
echo "Enter your name:"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"

# Display date and uptime
echo "Today is: $(date)"
echo "System uptime: $(uptime -p)"

# List files in the current directory
echo "Files in $(pwd):"
ls
This script covers variables, user input, commands, and simple tasks—a solid start for DevOps workflows.

Arrays
An array is like a list or a bunch of boxes where you can keep different things. 
Each box has a number called an index to find it.
