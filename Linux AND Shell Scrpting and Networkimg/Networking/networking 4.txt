Basis:

Internet: Is globally web computers connected to  each other by wires. Like  super high way.
ISP- Internet service provider.
ISP: The company that provides your internet connection. Without an ISP, you can't connect to the internet.

1.Network - Combination of two more computers connected together to share their resources each other
by means of communication like cable is called Network. connecting servers via medium 
to get network option we need requirment.

In an office, all computers are connected so employees can share files and use the same printer.
This setup is called a network.

When you browse a website, your computer sends a request through the internet to a server 
that holds the website’s data,and the server sends the webpage back to you.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          NIC stands for Network Interface Card.
(Built into the motherboard – This is inside the CPU cabinet, directly on the motherboard.)
 The bridge between your computer and the internet or local network.
 This hardware device allows your computer to connect to the network (like a router or switch).

Physical NIC: Your computer has a Wi-Fi adapter or an Ethernet card. 

Ethernet card (NIC): It has a port where you plug in an Ethernet cable to connect your computer to a wired network.
Wi-Fi adapter (NIC): It allows your computer to connect wirelessly to a Wi-Fi network.

What Happens:
You plug the Ethernet cable into your NIC (the network card in your computer).
The NIC now allows your computer to communicate with the network.
The operating system will create a network interface (like eth0), 
which is how the system manages the network connection through that physical NIC.

NIC: Think of it as a port or slot where you plug the cable.
Cable: The physical connection that allows data to travel.
Network Interface: The software side (like eth0) that uses the NIC to send and receive data.

In short, you plug the Ethernet cable into the NIC, and the NIC makes it possible for the computer 
to connect to the network.



Each NIC card will be having MAC  (Media Access Controller) address to avoid conflicts 
between same NIC adapters.

Imagine your computer and your phone are on the same Wi-Fi network.

Your computer's MAC address might be: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E.
Your phone's MAC address might be: F0:2F:3D:4E:5F:6A.
These unique MAC addresses allow the router to know which device is sending and receiving data.

---------------------
Linux NIC adapters rep by "eth" using comment if config.

For example if two NIC cards are there in a system then it will be denoted as   "etho","eth1", .....etc.,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NIC in linux;
NIC:Network interface is a connection point for sending and receiving data.

                                                   Physical NICs (PHY)
What: Real hardware that connects to a network.

Examples:

eth0: Wired Ethernet connection.
wlan0: Wireless (Wi-Fi) connection.
Used for: Connecting to the internet or local network.

ip link show eth0   # For Ethernet
ip link show wlan0  # For Wi-Fi

-----------------------
                                                           Virtual NICs
What: Software-based network interfaces, not tied to physical hardware.

Examples:
lo: Loopback interface (connects to itself).
br0: Bridge interface (connects multiple networks).
tun0: Tunnel interface (used by VPNs).
Used for: Virtual environments or secure connections (e.g., VPN)

ip link show lo    # Loopback interface
ip link show br0   # Bridge interface
ip link show tun0  # VPN tunnel interface


-----------------------
Physical NICs: Real hardware for network connections (Ethernet/Wi-Fi).
Virtual NICs: Software-based for things like virtual machines or VPNs.
=========================================================================================
Windows uses physical NICs (Ethernet/Wi-Fi).
EC2 uses virtual NICs (ENIs or eth0) to connect VMs to networks in the cloud.
-------------------------------------------------
                                                 What is a packet?
A packet is a small chunk of data with an address, sent over a network. 
It’s like a letter in an envelope, where the letter is your data and 
the envelope contains the address and information.

In Linux, when you send data over a network, it is broken down into smaller packets.
 Each packet is sent individually to the destination and then reassembled into the complete data.

When you ping a website like google.com, your computer sends small packets to Google’s server, 
and the server sends them back, letting you know if the connection works.
If you want to check if a server is reachable, you can run:

ping google.com
This command sends packets to Google, and if they come back, it means the network is working.

A packet is a small piece of data that travels across the network.
Linux breaks down larger data into packets and sends them to their destination.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.Media is nothing but cable to connect two or systems. Example :  RJ 45, CAT 5 and CAT 6, ....etc.,
----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Topology-  Topology is a design in which the computers in network will be connected to each other.
Example for topologies 	are Bus, Ring, Star, Mesh, Tree topologies. Connectivity method.

Star Topology: All computers connect to a central hub (like a switch).
Ring Topology: Computers are connected in a circle, with each device linked to two others.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch - is like powerbank, allow devices to connect with in room.
router also has switch inside.
eg: In a school computer lab, a switch allows each computer to share files and access the internet.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Router-can combine multi network to gether.
IPS(Network cable)-Modem(Connects directly to the internet.)-router(Splits an internet connection to several devices.,
 Requires a modem to connect to the internet.)
 eg:  At home, your router connects your Wi-Fi devices (phones, tablets, etc.) to the internet.

-switch outside of the router.

ISP Cable → Modem (connects to the internet)
Modem → Router (splits the connection)
Router → Switch (distributes internet to multiple devices)
=================================================================================
OSI-Open sys interconnection - communication model of 7 layers
1. service- set of actions that layer after another layer
2. Interface - communication b/w layers.
============================================================================
Network sys geography:
1. Local Area Network    All computers in a school lab are connected through a LAN.
2. WAN (Wide Area Network): Covers a large geographical area, such as multiple cities or countries.
3. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Covers a city-wide area.
4. CAN- College computers
5. PAN (Personal Area Network):  (phone hostpot).
======================================================================================================

SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure way to connect to another computer over a network. 
It lets you log in and run commands remotely while keeping your data safe with strong encryption.
 SSH usually works on port 22.
======================================================================================
                                            Protocols: Rules for sending and receiving data over a network.

TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol 
eg:TCP/IP: Used for things like email, web browsing, and downloading files 
where it’s important that all data arrives correctly. 
For example, when you download a document, 
TCP/IP makes sure every part of the fileis received accurately.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UCD- User 	Datagram Protocol//
: Used for fast activities like streaming videos and online games. 
It focuses on speed, so some small parts might be missed, 
but it keeps things running smoothly without delays.

=======================================================================================
TCP                               UDP

1.Reliable protocol             1.Unreliable faster than  TCP
2. FTP,HTTP/s                   2. DNS,DHCP,ARP.. fast data transfer  
3.SSH,SMTPS,

--------------------------------------------------------------------
When we say a protocol is "reliable," it means it has built-in checks to make sure that:

All parts of the data arrive at their destination.
The data arrives in the correct order.
--------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP: http://example.com
HTTPS: https://example.com
When to Use HTTPS:
Sensitive Information: Always use HTTPS when transmitting sensitive information,
 such as passwords, credit card details, and personal data.
 
Websites: Use HTTPS for all websites to ensure data privacy and security for users.

APIs: Use HTTPS for APIs to protect data in transit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary:
HTTP: Unencrypted, suitable for non-sensitive data, uses port 80.

HTTPS: Encrypted, essential for sensitive data, uses port 443, provides data integrity and authentication.

Using HTTPS is a best practice for securing web communications and protecting user data from potential threats.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       Ports: 
These are like doors on your device that allow data to enter or leave for specific services.

eg: Laptop, USB, Charger port ==== same for mail service, FILE TRansfer, web service 

S/w level - port is logical construct that is used to identify the process or the network service that is being used.


Port no: help us to get connect to a particular server on the system. 0 to 65535


port associated with the IP address:

1. Well known ports - 0 to 1023. eg: DNS,HTTPS,HTTP, FTP....
2. Registered Ports - 1024 to 49151 eg: tomcat server reg port no with 8080.
3.Private Ports-49152 and 65535.

 
Network Protocols     Service Names:         Port no:
1.HTTP                 Web                    TCP80
2.HTTPS               server web              TCP443
3. DNS                Domain name service     UDP53
4. FTP                File transfer           TCP20,21
5. SSH                Secure shell terminal    TCP 22


eg: Running web server
1. food court (IP addrss)  sending req on (Https 443) - multi cusines(port nos)

port no 1. Indian
port no 2. Chines.... Port no serving diff services.

www - world wide web. all public page  or  web site user can access to local computer and other devices thrugh internet.
https://www.zomato.com/restaurants


https - Protocol:
Ensures secure communication between your browser and Zomato's servers.
Protects sensitive information, like login or payment details.

www - Subdomain:
Indicates it’s a publicly accessible web service.

zomato.com - Domain Name:
The main address (like the food court's name) where users can access Zomato's services.

/restaurants - Directory/Path:
Refers to the specific section (menu) of the website that lists restaurants.

-----------------------------------------------
Port Analogy for Zomato
Zomato's server is the food court (IP address).
The server has different ports (counters) to serve various requests:
Port 443: Handles secure HTTPS requests for browsing and ordering.
Port 80: (if HTTP is used) Handles basic, unsecured web browsing requests.
Database Port (e.g., 3306 for MySQL): Stores restaurant data, user reviews, and orders.

When you visit Zomato, your browser connects to the server via Port 443 (HTTPS) 
to securely fetch restaurant details.


website: a collection of  webpages and related content that is identify by common domain name and
published on at least one web server... 
Notable webiste: (google,fb)
==============================================================================================
What is Webserver
----------------------
A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) 
to serve the files that from Web pages to users, in response to their request.

Ex:
1) Apache HTTP Server
2) Internet Information Services (IIS)
3) nginx
4) httpd by Apache


What is httpd
---------------------
HTTP Daemon is a software program that runs in the background as a web server.
It waits for the incoming server requests. The daemon answers the request  and
serves the hypertext and multimedia documents over the Internet using HTTP.

=======================================================================================================
In short: IP addresses allow devices to find and talk to each other on the internet or a local network.
(Internet Protocol address)
IP Address: This is a unique address assigned to a network interface, 
allowing it to communicate on a network.
 The IP address identifies your device on a network, like 192.168.1.5 for a wired connection or 192.168.0.1 for a wireless one.

Each network interface (like eth0, wlan0) is assigned an IP address to communicate with other
 devices on the network. The IP address allows the interface to send and receive data.

Example:
Network Interface: eth0 (Ethernet interface)
IP Address: 192.168.1.5 (assigned to eth0)
Without an IP address, a network interface can't communicate on the network because there's no way to identify it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IP address: 1. Numeric address 2. Every device has IP  address for communication.
3. IP address to identify for a computer or device on a network.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IPv4:
Length:IPv4 has 32 bits. split into 4 parts, called octets (each 8 bits).
192.168.1.0.
Each bit can be either a 0 or a 1 (like a switch that's either "off" or "on").
So, for 8 bits, you can create many combinations of 0's and 1's.

How many combinations of 0's and 1's?
Each bit has 2 possible states: 0 or 1.
For 8 bits (one octet), the total combinations are:
=256 combinations.

This means that an octet can represent 256 different values, ranging from 0 to 255.
----------------------------------

Class	Range	Usage	First Octet Range
A	0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255	Large networks	0 to 127
B	128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255	Medium-sized networks	128 to 191
C	192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255	Small networks	192 to 223
D	224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255	Multicast	224 to 239
E	240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255	Research	240 to 255

IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, allowing for (2^{32}) unique addresses: 
[ 2^{32} = 4,294,967,296 \text{ (approximately 4.29 billion addresses)} ]

---------------------------------------------------------------
Why does the range go from 0 to 255?
Let's see what the numbers look like:
If you have 8 bits (like: 00000000), you get the smallest value, 0.
If you have all 1's (like: 11111111), you get the largest value, 255.

Here’s how 255 is calculated:
Each bit in the octet represents a power of 2:
The leftmost bit is worth 128 (2^7).
The next bit is worth 64 (2^6), and so on.
When all bits are set to 1 (11111111), it adds up like this:

128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1=255.
2^7+2^6+2^5+2^4+2^3+2^2+2^1+2^0=255

-----------------------------------------------------------
Total Addresses:
IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, allowing for (2^{32}) unique addresses: 
[ 2^{32} = 4,294,967,296 \text{ (approximately 4.29 billion addresses)} ]

But we ran out of public IPs, so we use private IPs like 192.168.x.x.  for  shortage created private IP.

Binary Representation (IPv4 Example: 192.168.1.0):
192.168.1.0        


192 is 1st oct= 128+64  Binary(0's 1's) format will be 11000000              128+64= 192
168 is 2nd oct= 128+32+8  binary format will be       10101000                     128+32+8=168
1             =                                       00000001 
0             =                                       00000000

==========================================================================================================
IPV4 - over 4 billion address available (2power 32 means 4 biilion)
2. IPV6  128/no oct - classses.   
Pv6 was created because IPv4 ran out of addresses. 
It provides many more IP addresses for devices and improves network efficiency, security, and setup.

Key points:
IPv4 has limited addresses, but IPv6 offers a huge number.
IPv6 makes devices easier to connect and more secure.


============================================================================================================
1. Public IP and Private IP.   

ISP assigns IP address to modeum(reg on the internet) - so we can access to www.
without IP we can't access internet. Unique no. IPV4 - over 4 billion address available - 
for  shortage created private IP.

Can't access internet in private IP. So private IP converts to public before access.

Network Address Translation (NAT):
Function: NAT translates private IP addresses to a public IP address before accessing the internet.
Example: Your router gets one public IP from your ISP and connects all your devices 
to the internet using that public IP.
eg:
1. Phone1,phone2..(private ip) -- router(public IP) - Internet.

Private IP translated to Public IP called NAT(Network address translation).
---------------------------------------------
IP classes The classes are  A,  B, C, D, E and the ranges are given below.

Private IP's  

Class	Private IP Range	Example Use Case
A	10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255	Corporate network for thousands of employees
B	172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255	University assigning IPs to labs and departments
C	192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255	Home network, Wi-Fi router assigning IPs to devices

Public IP: Assigned by ISP, unique, required for internet access.
Private IP: Used within local networks, assigned by router, requires NAT for internet access.
NAT: Translates private IP addresses to a public IP address.
IP Classes: A, B, C with specific ranges for private IP addresses.
==========================================================================================================


Linux has default files and folders that store system settings and information, 
like a "database" for managing operations.

1. /etc/sysconfig/network
What it does: Turns the network on/off and sets the system name.
Why important: Keeps basic network settings permanent.

NETWORKING=yes     # Turns the network ON
HOSTNAME=myserver  # Sets system name to 'myserver'

Hostname: Shows the name assigned to the system.
----------------------------------------------------------
2. /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
What it does: Controls each network connection (like Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
Why important: Manages how your system connects to networks.
Example file: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0


DEVICE=eth0         # Name of the network card
BOOTPROTO=dhcp      # Automatically get IP address
ONBOOT=yes          # Start the network when the system starts
------------------------------------------
3. /etc/hosts
What it does: Maps names to IP addresses (like a mini phonebook).
Why important: Helps find systems on the same network.

192.168.1.10 myserver  # 'myserver' points to IP 192.168.1.10

How it works: Type ping myserver → Connects to 192.168.1.10.
-----------------------
4. /etc/resolv.conf
What it does: Points to DNS servers (convert website names to IPs).
Why important: Helps find websites on the internet.

Example content:
nameserver 8.8.8.8  # Use Google’s DNS to resolve names like google.com

How it works: Type ping google.com → Finds its IP using 8.8.8.8.

==============================================================================================
Real-life Scenario:

File: /etc/hosts
If you add 192.168.1.100 testserver, typing ping testserver will connect to 192.168.1.100.

File: /etc/resolv.conf
Add nameserver 8.8.8.8, and it will use Google DNS to convert google.com to an IP.
======================================================================================
2ways to configure network...1. static network 2. dynamic network.

Satic ip:
You give your system a fixed address, like giving it a permanent house address.
IP address: 192.168.1.100
This address won't change even if the system restarts. It's always 192.168.1.100 when you want to find it.

 Dynamic IP (DHCP)
What it means: The system gets a new address every time, like when you get a new house address each time you move.
Example:
IP address: 192.168.1.101 today, but next time it might be something else like 192.168.1.102 after a restart.
The address changes automatically every time you restart the system.

Static IP (Google): Google Search Engine, Google Cloud services.
Dynamic IP (Google): Google Home, Gmail user connections.
==================================================================================
Network Service: Check if the network is active:

systemctl status network
------
Ping Command: Check internet connection:
ping www.google.com
0% packet loss: Internet is working.
100% packet loss: No connection to the server.
Press Ctrl+C to stop the ping test.


whenver we tried to check netwrok, the data send form of packets to google,now google will recive 
and send them back to same server.
ping 192...dummy server..100%packet loss-  I don't have connnectivty to this server.
=======================================================================

SELinux helps control who can access things on your system (like files and programs).

Two Modes:
Enforcing: SELinux checks everything. If something is not allowed, it stops it.
Permissive: SELinux doesn't block anything but just logs what would have been blocked.
---------------------------------------------------------
Commands:
getenforce: Check if SELinux is on or off.
setenforce 0: Switch to Permissive mode (no blocking, just logging).
setenforce 1: Switch to Enforcing mode (blocks anything that’s not allowed).
------------------------------------------------------------------
Files:
/etc/selinux/config: This file controls if SELinux is on or off.
Log File: /var/log/audit/audit.log logs SELinux activity.
In simple terms, SELinux is a security tool that decides what users and apps can do on your system.
=======================================================================================================
