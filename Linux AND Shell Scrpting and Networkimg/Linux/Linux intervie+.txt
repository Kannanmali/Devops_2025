1.How do you find out the current run-level of a Linux system?
The runlevel command or who -r can be used to determine the current run-level.
run-level 5  2025-01-27 12:34

Runlevel 5: This is a mode where your system allows multiple users to log in and also shows a graphical interface (like Windows or macOS desktop). Itâ€™s the regular mode for using your computer with a graphical display.
In short, runlevel 5 = normal computer use with a GUI.

run-level 5: The system is currently in runlevel 5, which usually means it's in multi-user mode with a graphical user interface (GUI).
The date and time show when the system switched to runlevel 5. So, if you see something like:
=====================================================================================

Find IP address: ifconfig or ip addr.
Kill process: kill <PID>.
chmod vs chown: chmod changes permissions, chown changes owner.
Concatenate files: cat.
sed: Used for search and replace in text.
Check open ports: netstat or ss.
Ping host: ping.
apt-get vs apt: apt-get for package tasks, apt is simpler.
Install package: apt install <package>.
Update/Upgrade: apt update updates, apt upgrade upgrades.
umask: Sets default file permissions.
Uptime: uptime.
System processes: top.
Cron job: A scheduled task.
Archive/Compression: tar for archive, gzip/bzip2 for compression.
Monitor resources: top, free, or vmstat.
===============================================
1.Troubleshooting a slow Linux server:
Check system resource usage with top or htop.
Check disk usage with df -h and               du -sh.    Check for Disk Usage by Folder:


Look for high CPU usage or processes with ps aux.
Check logs in /var/log/ (e.g., syslog, dmesg).
tail -f /var/log/syslog

Restart a Service: If a service is not responding, restart it:
sudo systemctl restart apache2



------------------------------------------------
2.Securing a Linux server:
This keeps your system packages up to date with security fixes.
Update System:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
-------------------
Disable Unused Services:
sudo systemctl disable apache2
-----------------------
Use a firewall: sudo ufw enable.
Set up SSH key authentication instead of passwords.
Disable root login via SSH in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
================================================================
3.Monitoring server performance:
Use top or htop to check CPU and memory usage.
Use vmstat for system statistics.
Use iostat for disk performance.
Use netstat to check network connections.
========================================
4.Recovering from filesystem corruption:
Run fsck to Fix Filesystem:
sudo fsck /dev/sda1
This checks and repairs filesystem issues on the partition /dev/sda1.
---------
Boot from a Live USB: If the system doesn't boot, use a live USB to repair the disk.

Restore from Backup: If you have a backup, restore it:
rsync -av /backup /home
===============================
Automating tasks:
Using Cron (Scheduling Tasks): To run a script daily at 2 AM:
========================
Using systemd for Recurring Tasks: Create a service file (/etc/systemd/system/mytask.service):

[Unit]
Description=My recurring task

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/your/script.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
------------
Then enable and start it:
sudo systemctl enable mytask.service
sudo systemctl start mytask.service
=============================================
Using at for One-Time Tasks: Schedule a task to run once at a specific time:

echo "/path/to/your/script.sh" | at 2pm
===========================================================
