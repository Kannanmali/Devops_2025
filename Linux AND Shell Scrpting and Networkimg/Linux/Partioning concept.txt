Basic Concepts
Volume: A block of storage in AWS that we can attach to an EC2 instance 
(similar to an external hard drive).
Partition: A way to divide a volume into smaller sections.
Mounting: The process of making a storage device (like a volume)
accessible at a particular point in the directory structure.


You have an EC2 instance with one main storage volume (root volume). 
You want to add another volume, partition it, format it, mount it, and make it permanently available, 
even after a reboot.










ec2 instance has one volume storage -  /dev/xvda 8gb is root volume.single volume.

If server crash - data lost- concept called mounting- create one volume and attach to o/s - 
 so vol applications file can store this called mounting.
 
if server crashed doesn't happen to vol. so we can detacch and attach the server to another volume.
-----------------------------------------------------------
when come to pa /dev/xvdf max 4 partion on 3 primary and 1 is extended.

Maximum of 4 partitions on a disk like /dev/xvdf.
3 Primary partitions: These are the main partitions where data is stored 
(e.g., /dev/xvdf1, /dev/xvdf2, /dev/xvdf3).

1 Extended partition: This is used to create more partitions inside it.
 It doesnâ€™t store data directly but allows additional logical partitions (e.g., /dev/xvdf4).

 Steps to Attach, Partition, and Mount a New Volume:



1. Attach the New Volume to Your EC2 Instance
EBS- attach this volume to your EC2 instance.-2GB - same av zone.
--------------------------------
2. Check That the Volume is Attached
sudo fdisk -l
You should see a list of volumes. Look for your new volume, 
which should be listed as /dev/xvdf. This confirms the volume is attached.
--------------------------------------------------------------
3. Partition the New Volume
 A partition is like creating a section of the volume to store files.
 
 sudo fdisk /dev/xvdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This opens the fdisk tool, which is used to create and manage partitions on a disk.
((
Create the Partition:

In fdisk, do the following:]

Type n and press Enter (to create a new partition).
Type p and press Enter (to select primary partition type).
Press Enter to accept the default partition number (usually 1).
Press Enter to accept the default first sector.
Type +2G and press Enter (to create a partition that is 2GB in size).

Save and Exit:

Type w and press Enter (to write the partition to the disk and exit fdisk).

))
------------------------------------
sudo fdisk -l
You should now see a partition named /dev/xvdf1, which is a 2GB partition on your new volume.
=======================================================================
4. Format the Partition
To make the new partition usable, we need to format it with a file system 
(a structure that organizes files on the partition).

sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/xvdf1
This formats the partition with the ext3 file system, which allows the partition to store files.
================================================================================
5. Create a Directory to Mount the Partition
sudo mkdir /root/appdata
=========================================
6. Mount the Partition to the Directory
sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /root/appdata

This command mounts /dev/xvdf1 (the new partition) to the /root/appdata directory.
Check the Mount:df -h
This shows the disk usage. You should see /dev/xvdf1 listed with 2GB of space, mounted to /root/appdata.
=============================================================================================
7. Make the Mount Permanent

To ensure that the mount stays even after a reboot, we need to add it to the /etc/fstab file, 
which is a file where Linux stores information about permanent mounts.

sudo vi /etc/fstab
Move to the bottom of the file and enter the following line:

/dev/xvdf1   /root/appdata   ext3   defaults   0   0

This line tells Linux to mount /dev/xvdf1 to /root/appdata using the ext3 file system everytime the system starts.

Save and Close the Editor:
=============================================================
Test the Configuration:

Run: sudo mount -a
This command checks if /etc/fstab is correctly configured and mounts any new entries.
-----------------------
Verify:
Run df -h 
again to confirm that /dev/xvdf1 is still mounted at /root/appdata.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, your new 2GB volume is partitioned, formatted, and permanently mounted to /root/appdata, 
and it will remain mounted even after a reboot.
