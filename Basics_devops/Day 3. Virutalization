Plain land-constructed house-1Acer. All resources park swmimg pool everythn-happily.
Now I feel Don't need one acer just want 1/2 acer. But im watiing 1/2 acer.
Idea-1/2 another property build-rent. both two not interfearing with each other resources. 
Now effecinectly started using the resources.

Devops is all about = imp effeciency==End goal..

Real world sw industyr problem:
Server=we have app in local laptop- we developed app- now wants deliver to customer.or real world.
Google.com=hosted in public server that why we access it called server.
Inside the server-- Google.com org bought 5 servers diff size-from HP. HP selling server.
Sys admin bought 5 servers-they deplyed app1 server1(4GBRAM)and 4CPU. Size 100GB and 100Core.
But we deployed app of 4GB and 4 cpu.

All developers and testers using this to test your app. The app server probably tomcat serrver.
I started this app on this server. but late relaize need only 4GB and 4CPU.
wasting entire resources.. 
Or I gave each 1 server to one one team-I reliaze that all are wating inefficienty using.
Unutilzing 90% resoirces=== inefficiency...

That's why virtuaization came into picture.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Physiacl server from IBM SEVER1-I have this concept I installed "Hypervuisor"
Hypervuisor=SW that can install in VM on your bare metal or physiacl server.

Now instated one I have created 5 servers-logical partition(logical isolation)-VM1 VM2 VM3 VM4

they are Veritual macghines-don;t exsisyt physiacelly.Now I have added eff by adding the Hypervuisors.
populsr hypervisor:
1.VMware 2.Zen 
we do logical isolation-we made logical machiesn. 
Now team 1 can user VM1,team2-VM2 team3-VM3 3tc...

VM=create Virtal env that functions as virtuel systems. this system has their own CPU,Own Memory,Hardware.
So VM1 not depeding on VM2 for meomory or CPU or harware..thats why called logical own systems.
Hypervuisor is doing this process -creating VM.
---------------------------------------
eg:Same concept followed in cloud platform.
Amazon-mumbai--data centre--they take huge land and install physial servers-like 1000's... servers.
Now user -- req -- AWS-- select mumbai-- req send the data center--- phy server--hypervisor installed in phy server.
Then the hyperrviosr creats VM for you.  This is world of VM operts on Hypervisor
----------------------------------------------
Latency is the delay in data travel. Mumbai server is closer, so less delay. Singapore is farther, so more delay.
Aws had data center in Singapore and serves installed using rackes.
Aws admin created multiple racks like multiple serves
If req ec2 VM- the hypervisor sees my req and allocates to me. Aws will give ip and key value pair to access 
the resources. We're hosted on Singapore data center.
