IT - info data one to another person - gng thru computer.

que on how it works:
1.what-images,pdf videos etc.. 2.where-per to person or loc to location or compant to company
3.when-24/7*365 4.why??-planning decion problem solving and saves money..5.how all happening??
thru the IT components..

facts of IT??
1.like we have tech everwhere..

Major it components:
1.Hradware 
2.O/S
3.App/Sw
4.Networking
5.Security 

Enterprise level components:
1.Storage 2.Databse 3.Virtualization 4.Cloud.
=============================================================================================
Hardware needs O/S to work but before see what is inside the hardware.
1.Hardware-1st piece of IT tech. Pieces of bricks-makes box.
motherboard-all little circuits,memory,CPUall circtus,
RAM - Random access memory. Bcz memory holds your info temp while you opening up a programmme.
CPU-human brain it does calculation for you.
Chip sets top on motherboard.. 
Harddrive - inside harware wer you store-all info stays there when you trun off the computer.
Fan-to keep all devices inside cool. 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
((RAM: RAM is fast, temporary memory used by the computer for active tasks. 
It gets erased when the device is turned off.
RAM: Think of RAM like a table where you watch a video. 
The video plays on the table, but once you turn off your laptop,everything on the table is gone.
--------------------------------------------------------------

ROM: ROM is permanent memory that stores important instructions 
(like how to start the device). It stays even when the device is off.))

ROM: Think of ROM like a book that tells your laptop how to start. 
Even when the laptop is off, the book stays the same and helps the laptop turn on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
O/S: Imp program runs on computer.tells hardware what to do.
basic task-finding input from keyboard to seng o/p to display screen. keeping track of files and 
directories on disk and controlling  power fuul dfevice like disk driver and printers.

Human body is hardware-O/s is spirit inside tells what to do?
So O/s tells sys what to do. like move hand from signals.

eg: file edited-print--its sends O/S takes that command-sends to harware tell to print it.
==============================
APP/SW??

O/S-is just a SW-written in C C++
App -also SW but it runs on top of O/S- 
So when you start O/S the u start your application.

APp- user trun on computer to use app(microsoft app excel ppt etcc, broweser,..etc..)
Server level app:
1.ERP-Enterprise resource plannig
2.CRM-customer relation manager
3.Server applications((active directory,database,DNS, NTP etc).

====================================================================
Databse: 
A orgnized structured collection of data..

DBMS- databse mangement system.
1.DBMS-system is a SW for creating and mananging the database.
SW-allows to manage data profestionally.

types:
1. Centarlized DB
2.Distributed DB.

DB config:
1.Local-You can run the local DB with in your computer.
2.External-You could have an app runnning on computer which connects - to an external DB.
Like also other computer that only rusn the DB SW. SW is DBMS..

Virtulazation and Cloud:
-----------------------
Enterprise level IT components:
1.Storage - like harddrive comes with computer--But big companuies--use external storage..
like 1000 of disc.. 
2.Database-Strcuted way of putting info together.
3.virtualization and Cloud..
