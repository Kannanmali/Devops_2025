1. what is devops?
Its a pract or culture that incr org ability to deliver the app.
End of the day - org delivery the app. end goal- delivery..
example.com- 10days taking for delivery.. (v1 to v2 for new feature)than thats not good practice.
If app has a bug-instaged of taking 10days if all issues sort out and delivery in 1 hour 
than its called devops.

Devops- is a flow or process of building depolying app and monitoring app.

CI/CD-devops is improving delivery and they have to include the automation process.
chip company - made auto now delivery all in one day---also they look at quality as well.
enduser-need quality   manufacture--needs fast delivery..(automation)

Monitoring-how would ensure quaity maintaed-we have to build in monitoring.
If anything issue in quality or issue in automation somebody -reports back to you. 
that is monitoeing..

Testing--imp aspect..
-------------------------------------------------
Interview queustions:

Devops-process of imp "delivery(app delivery)" - making delivery quicker by proper "automation". 
By ensurred "quality (maintained)"in place-"monitoing(continuos"or observability 
-also u have contionus testing..    End goal- no manual process-during app delivery-fasten up the 
process. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal-expect - app delivery in 2 weeks-reduce 2 weeks to one. but by ensuing all the above in place.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Why should i hire??
WHy devops? 
developer-write SC(anroid or static web app)-company example.com---end goal---
Customer uses the app..  dev-write code   and customer -- receive the app.

If no devops: end idea-- from dev laptop the app to deliver to customer end..
1.once dev write code-put in central loaction-after that central loca--sys admin or build engg-
create the server-they deploy the app on server..
Then - tester test that app-on the server create by system admin..
then build and release engg-he would promot to next level-pre prod.(well tested on pre prod)

then the release engg take forward the app -- to customer on production server.

App-developer--- code repo--  to Prod customer ===============Goal end Goal.
------------------------------------------

Sys admin-creates server--needs to test on server not laptop.(VM were used).

BRE - build and relase engg.-he deployed app on to the server.
To delopy there should be application server..

Server admin-so this admin creates the app server.. 
Simply deliver the app from developer laptop-- to customer--- entire process taking 10days.
=====================================================
All this manual--to automate--all the teams working together the deliver the app..
Now to improve -- devops concept comes..
Devpos======((Its a culsture(way of working)bcz new tools comes--adopt the new tools))
improve process of deliver. 
By ensurred "quality (maintained)"in place-"monitoing(continuos"or observability 
-also u have contionus testing..    End goal- no manual process-during app delivery-fasten up the 
process. 

By all finally --- improves effeciency of the org that's role of devops.


=====================================================================================

How to introduce abt your self??

Im working as devops engg- past 4 to 5 years. before Non IT....or system admin..

roles:I take of auto - ensure qua maintain for app and ensure that cont monitoring.
I have automated tetsing process to devops life cycle.

(if interview asking tools we can mentioned)

     API

API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows one application to communicate with another.
Zomato uses Google Maps API to show locations on its app. Instead of building its own maps, 
Zomato sends requests to Google Maps' API, and Google responds with the map data.

Client Makes a Request: Zomato req  to google maps- "Show the map for a restaurant's address."
API Server Processes the Request: Google Maps receives the request and checks if it’s valid.
API Responds: Google sends back the map data (coordinates, images, etc.) to Zomato.

You’re a DevOps engineer managing cloud instances and want to get details of all active servers on AWS.
1.Client-The client is your device or application where the request starts.
2.Request-The client sends a request to the API server asking for data or a service.
When you type curl https://api.example.com/users, your client is asking the server for user data.
3.Server :The API server processes the request, performs the task, or fetches data.
Example: A Zomato server might fetch restaurant data.
4.Response
The server sends back the requested data (or an error message if something went wrong).
Example: A list of restaurants is sent back as a response to your client.

The API server is created by developers or backend engineers in an organization. Here's how it works:
Design the API-Developers decide what data or service the API will provide.
Set Up a Server-Developers create a server (a computer or cloud instance) that will process API requests.
Write Code for the API-Developers write code to handle requests and send back responses.
Store Data-The server connects to a database where the required information is stored.
Example: Restaurant details stored in a database.
Make It Accessible:
The server is made available on the internet through a URL or endpoint (like https://api.zomato.com/restaurants).

In simple terms, developers build the API server, and DevOps engineers maintain it to make sure it works well.

API call : An API call is when one system asks another system to do something using an API.
