dev-writes code like 2025 goals and should save in DB and to reach the world wide (www).

If student writes code in office-to show dem in office-its working on my machine but not in clinet machine.
So if we create link and that app will work on any machine called devops.

Dev= devloper code.
Ops=scale app, put out for the world..
development operations== sending the app to world in fast..
devops is culture--less time == dev code send to world wide...fast and secure..
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
why??
we use chatgpt--we message and we get red signal-- too many signal server can't handle..
(2022)-- in deeepseek.. = send some msg = if something we see like network error...like that (2022)
still its was happening... But they have devops and cloud practise.. they send app world with LB cloud support..
So now no issues..

If coder writes - deepseekk-- then devops and cloud demand gonna incr..
1.After deepseek- Alibaba - qunmax-- same issue - it can't scale..
So rthey mneed devops and cloud..(alibab-aws-google etcc AI--so AI gomnna speed same time devops getting high)
to run world wide - infra scalabilty,,,etc...
If we have skills- we can transfer business....
===============================================================================================
How to learn??
1.devops - cluure mindset methedology..Learn 1 cloud like AWS.

1.dev-write code(put it in github)-code working in local..
2.So that code (github)should be work in all machines(LIKE IN LINUX).
we need to run the code - we need tool doicker- docker build the app..
Once docker build next is test-- then we use testing like eg sonar qube to test the app..
sonarauber- code quality..
3.finally--once test then deploy-- to the VM or compute like a server..(or a computer).----- so that www can access.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.code---build---test--deploy..(whener code build test or deploy)== Infinity called devops.
2. when we store code called code storage...

code build- aws 
sonaraube--test aws also available..
deploy- aws ec2 or eks (k8s) or azure VM or Azure AKS..Or own server..
So learn 1 server - just name gonna change - tech and culture metholdgy are same..
