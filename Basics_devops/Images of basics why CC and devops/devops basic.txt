why Cloud Computing?

owner of small IT firm-scale your buisness-or need large no of resources like,
Office space,more hardware,furntinure,lot of people to manage and lot of money..
This are captial expenditures.
Now recurring expenses:cost of regular harware manitance,salaries to employes,electicity bills,
monthly rents of busilding..--This are operational expensive..

Stop?? minize the expenses.. and build system that scalable,high available,security,high performance.
Use Cloud computing:

Cloud Computing?
To run an application, you must purchase computing, storage, and hardware. 
Cloud computing minimizes these upfront expenses, and you can rent or lease hardware 
from cloud providers such as AWS/Azure/GCP.

CC is way to access these computer resources and services over the internet.
Instaed of having to buy and managing your self.

buy the hardware nooooo=== rent everything...
eg:
We need to run sw progarme to store large files-instaed of buying hard disk drive.
rent storage like aws s3 or azure storage--where we can store and make use of it remotly.

Iaas:
infra as of service.
gives full control over infra resources like VM/storage etc.
You must takecare of all admin tasks like patching,upgrades and backup..
Pay as per use.
AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VM

---------------------------------
Patching means fixing issues or improving software by applying updates.
Your Linux server has software that is outdated and vulnerable.
The company releases a "patch" (a small update) to fix it.
sudo yum update  
Patching = Fixing problems by updating.
--------------------------------------
Platform as a service.
Paas:PaaS = A ready-made platform to deploy apps and start using it.
Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Service

---------------------------------------
Saas= Software as a service.
SaaS: You directly use the software (e.g., Google Docs).
Gmail, Google Drive, Salesforce

IaaS: You control everything (OS, apps, etc.).
PaaS: You focus on building apps; platform is managed.
SaaS: You just use the software; everything else is managed.

IaaS = Rent a house (you manage it).
PaaS = Furnished house (you live in it).
SaaS = Hotel room (just enjoy the service)
==================================================================================================

work long delivery time or maing changes.
To fix advance model== Agile..
ref SS.== happy customer,more cost effcetive,product deliver is on time,priorties changes.
